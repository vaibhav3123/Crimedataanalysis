# ðŸ“Š Crime Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of over **1 million crime records** to uncover crime distribution, victim demographics, temporal patterns, and geographical trends. The goal is to provide actionable insights for improving **public safety** and **law enforcement strategies**.

The analysis was conducted using **Python**, leveraging libraries such as **Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib** for data manipulation and visualization.

## Methodology

### Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Extracted** data from crime reports database.
- **Removed duplicates** and handled missing values.
- **Standardized date formats** to ensure consistency.
- **Normalized crime category labels** to unify classifications.

### Data Analysis Techniques

## Key Insights & Recommendations

### Law Enforcement & Resource Allocation
- **Increase surveillance and patrolling** in high-crime areas (e.g., Central area).
- **Deploy targeted vehicle theft prevention programs**, such as improved parking security and tracking technology.
- **Allocate additional law enforcement resources** during peak crime months.

### Community-Based Initiatives
- **Develop crime prevention programs** in neighborhoods with rising crime rates.
